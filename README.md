# Talman2Batmanizer

Tiny web proxy for [the Swedish parliament website](www.riksdagen.se) that replaces "talman" (Speaker of the Riksdag) with "Batman":

I did one of these ages ago in PHP and started to miss it. That one was statically generated, though, and this one is a (slightly cached) proxy.

Sinatra on Heroku.


# TODO

- Follow search redirects.
- Maybe link to some key pages like:
  - http://t2b.dev/sv/Sa-funkar-riksdagen/Ordbok/batman/
  - http://t2b.dev/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Kammaren/Protokoll/
